Want all your faves at your fingertips?

Never remember where to import that learner from?

Say `LinearDiscriminantAnalysis`?

... was it `from sklearn`?

... was it `from sklearn.linear_model`?

... ah no! It was `from sklearn.discriminant_analysis import LinearDiscriminantAnalysis`.

Sure, you can do that. Or you can simply type `from aix.Lin...` click tab, and; there it is! 
Select, enter, and moving on with real work.

*Note: This is meant to get off the ground quickly 
-- once your code is stable, you should probably import your stuff directly from it's origin*
